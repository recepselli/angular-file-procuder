# Angular File Procuder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Description
With this small project, you can upload a CSV file and convert it to either XML or JSON file.
My aim was to show off how to use composite specification pattern to run some validation rules against the data in CSV file and also show off how to use factory method pattern to create a file with the selected type from selectbox from the UI.

Specifications rules can be found under the specifications folder and factory method can be found under the factory folder.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
